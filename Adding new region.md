New regions should be added only in production environment. That adds some challenges to test if added region works but this tutorial should help:
-   **Determine the new region**: Identify the target region for the server addition.
-   **Setup infrastructure**: Provision the required servers, storage, and network resources.
-   **Configure and integrate**: Integrate the new servers with existing infrastructure components.
-   **Replicate and synchronize data**: Implement mechanisms to synchronize files and data across regions.
-   **Test and verify**: Perform comprehensive testing to ensure functionality and performance.
-   **Deploy and rollout**: Deploy changes to the production environment in a coordinated manner.
-   **Monitor and maintain**: Monitor performance, apply updates, and perform regular maintenance tasks.
